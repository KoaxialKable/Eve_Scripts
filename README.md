## Eve_Scripts
Some Eve_API scripts I've been tinkering with.

#### API TESTS
This is just where I first started employing python to interface with Eve Online's api.

#### EPAAG (Eve Pilots at-a-Glance)
*Under heavy construction!*
A tool using the Tkinter library to generate a windowed application written in python.
I can't really compete with other apps or services out there, so I guess we'll just see where it ends up.
